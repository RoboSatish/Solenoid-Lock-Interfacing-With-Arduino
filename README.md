# Solenoid-Lock-Interfacing-With-Arduino

A Solenoid lock is just like a normal or manual lock. The difference is only the solenoid locks operate with the electricity. So this can be used at many places just like fingerprint security door lock.

# How Does it Work?
:point_right:  The solenoid lock is controlled by Arduino, it generates the signals so the lock turns on and off after the delay of a second. <br />
:point_right: The lock is not directly connected with the Arduino instead of it we use a relay module. <br />
:point_right: You can found these types of locks on the doors, safes, and cupboards nowadays. you need to interface one relay also If you are not aware of the interfacing of the Relay module with Arduino then check it first. <br />
:point_right: As the lock works with electricity so in case of power failure the lock can’t be opened or closed. You can use different sensors with it to make a high-security lock system. <br />
:point_right: The solenoid lock needs a 12-volts DC supply for its functioning so you have to provide it. <br />
:point_right: Unlike manual locks, a solenoid lock is more secure and you don’t need any key to open it as it works on electricity. <br />
